# TaskManagementPortal (In Progress) ![Coming Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-coming%20soon-orange)

**This repository is currently under development.**

I'm actively working on making the source code of this project public for demonstration purposes. Once available, it will showcase:

- Full-Stack .NET development (ASP.NET Core MVC/Razor Pages)  
- SQL Server database management and Entity Framework  
- Authentication, role management, and secure APIs  
- Frontend with Bootstrap, jQuery, and interactive dashboards  
- Mobile and cloud integration where applicable  

**⚠️ Note:**  
Currently, the code is private while I complete development. The public version will be available soon, with full documentation, screenshots, and examples.
