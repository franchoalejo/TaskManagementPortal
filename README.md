# TaskManagementPortal ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

A **professional yet simple Task Management Portal** demonstrating modern **full-stack .NET development** with real-world integrations.  
This project is designed as a learning and showcase tool for developers and organizations looking for a practical example of enterprise-ready architecture.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

TaskManagementPortal allows users to **create, manage, and track tasks** efficiently.  
It includes **interactive dashboards**, **reminders via Windows notifications**, and a **clean responsive UI**.

This repository showcases:

- Full CRUD operations for tasks with assigned owners.
- Dynamic dashboards with real-time task summaries.
- Windows Toast notifications powered by PowerShell.
- Integration of **Node.js** scripts and automation demos.
- Examples of API consumption and modular architecture.
- A clear separation between **frontend**, **backend**, and **automation scripts**.

The **goal** is to serve as:
- A reference for developers learning **full-stack .NET Core (MVC + Razor)**.
- A demonstration of **clean, maintainable, and scalable design patterns**.
- A proof of concept of how multiple technologies (PowerShell, Node, SQL) can work together.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

This project combines a wide set of modern technologies:

### **Backend**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC & Razor Pages** – Controllers, Views, and Dependency Injection.

- **jQuery & Vanilla JS** – For interactivity and AJAX calls.
- **Chart.js** – Dynamic and animated task analytics.
- **Responsive Layout** – Three main dashboard panels with flexible grid layout (1 row on desktop, stacked on mobile).

### **Automation & Integrations**
- **PowerShell Scripts** – Windows Toast notifications for task reminders (`show_reminder.ps1`), reading task summaries dynamically.
- **Node.js (for future enhancements)** – Scripts and demos for task automation and integrations.
- **Cross-platform ready** – Architecture designed for cloud and local execution.

> **Note:** All technology links point to official vendor/developer documentation for deeper learning.
